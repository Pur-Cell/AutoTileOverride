To add a AutoTileOverride into your project: right-click > 2D > Auto Tile Override.

Set the "Tile Keyword" to any string and it will match with adjacent AutoTileOverrides that share the keyword.

Setting up the AutoTileOverride is exactly like setting up the normal Unity AutoTile and can use the same template file.
